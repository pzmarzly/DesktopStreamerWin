# Desktop Streamer (Windows version)
### C utility to start a desktop stream with VLC and broadcast it fact over TCP
### made with Raspberry Pi integration in mind, default configuration is compatible with Pi Zero W

This is my first C project. It uses WinAPI, OpenMP and cmake. I wrote a helper library while working on this project, you can find it in src/utils.

# Installing

Install VLC. Then download this project's binary file or build it. Place the files anywhere, just make sure to invoke the programs with the same working directory, as it is the place where the config will be stored.

# Building

Requirements:
- TDM-GCC
- CMake

Recommended:
- ninja build system

Add all of them to PATH, then call:

    mkdir build
    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ninja

If you don't use ninja, adjust your commands.

# Limitations

- this program will behave unexpectedly if the config file is corrupt/incorrect
